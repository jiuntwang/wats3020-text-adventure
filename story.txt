WATS Survival - Text Adventure - Story Version


A light fog dissipates as a shadowed figure stirs with his hand tracing the lines of a symbolic crest painted on the ground. His eyes shift wildly trying to transcribe the meaning of each stroke and color. Unsure of what he is seeing, he stands up and looks around the unknown territory. 


“So this is where these ‘Devs’ come from…” He murmured under his breath while his hand reached to his waist instinctively feel his blunt club used for protection. Not that his weapons would do much damage, he did feel safer with it at his side if he ever encountered one of these ‘Devs’ he’s heard so much about. It was a legend to witness a ‘Dev’ in the flesh, and come back the same alive. Some warriors come home insane and others are so fascinated by the ‘Devs’ that they disappear in the darkness and never come back. 


This fresh warrior named Thomas was ready to face these legendary ‘Devs’ and make sure to put a stop to their evil ways of torturing the minds of his clan.  Brushing the dust from the ends of his frayed cloak, he takes in a deep breath and takes a step forward up a steep path. His leg muscles were straining with each step and beads of salted water flowed down the sides of his face. Cursing a few words here and there while making his trek uphill, he started to hear something enticing in the distance that made his ears tickle. What is that sound? His eyebrows raised, he took a moment to pause in his track and closed his eyes to heighten his hearing ability. 


It’s music.


His eyes flashed open, and his pace started to quicken as the sounds started to entice and tickle his ears. It was a mix of sounds that he has never hear before, and the pain in his legs had soon faded from his thoughts. Veering off to the left of the main path, he had finally reached the source of the music.
